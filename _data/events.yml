  description: |
    May 28th is approaching and we're really excited.

    No, not because of
    [Kylie Minogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c18441Eh_WE)'s birthday.
    It's time for the May Edition of the Budapest Python Meetup!

    [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#pick-fantastic-devs) is sponsoring us again
    and thanks to them we'll be able to provide a free drink to everyone.

    If you've been to the meetup before, you've probably seen some lightning
    talks: they're really short presentations (maximum 5 minutes) about a
    Python-related topic.

    Well, this month, we're going to have a little experiment and hold a
    lightning talk session.

    If there's a topic you want to talk about: a cool Python library you've
    written or discovered, a Python tool that you love, an experiment you did
    using Python…

    Then please sign up for the lighting talk, either by filling in the form or
    simply by commenting on this post.

        Functional programming has become a very popular paradigm recently. When
        we hear the words ‘functional programming’ usually the first things that
        come to our mind are languages like Haskell, ML or Elm. But is it
        possible to use Python the functional way? The language claims to
        support functional programming, let’s see how it’s done. In my
        presentation I’m going to quickly walk you through the functional
        toolset of Python, then we are going to see how these can be applied on
        a widely known code kata while having fun.

    Hello everyone!

    April is here and we have exciting news for you.

    We’ve teamed up with the fine folks at
    [CraftConf](http://craft-conf.com/2015) to bring you two renowned
    international speakers: Katherine Daniels and Jeremy Edberg.

    For logistical reasons out of our hands, we’re going to have to start the
    meetup a little bit earlier than usual so make sure you arrive on time if
    you don’t want to miss the talks.

    And of course, each attendee is entitled to a free drink, generously paid
    for by this month's sponsor, [Mito](https://mito.hu/). Thanks, Mito!

          the world of operations at NYC-based startups, she spent a few years
          doing QA and systems engineering in the corporate world. She lives in
          Brooklyn with a perfectly reasonable number of cats, and in her spare
          time can often be found rock climbing or making hot sauce.

        Starting at a new company can feel overwhelming, with all the new people
        to meet and new technology to learn. This can be especially true as a
        member of a minority group, where we can unfortunately often feel out of
        place even without the additional pressure of being the ‘n00b’. When
        you’re starting a new job, what resources are available to help? How can
        you find allies and prioritize all the side quests and meeting requests?
        While there aren’t any guaranteed cheat codes that can make your first
        weeks or months at a new job go flawlessly, this talk will provide a few
        pointers and tips for making your starting adventures as successful as
        they can be.

        At this meetup you'll hear how when I started at reddit in 2007 I had
        never written a line of Python in my life, and by 2010 I was presenting
        at Pycon. I'll talk about how I learned Python on the job and some of
        the things I had to figure out about Python in a virtualized cloud
        environment, something very few people had ever dealt with at that
        point. You'll also get to hear updated results of the experiment I
        last conducted in 2010, specifically for Pycon.

    Whether you're a beginner just discovering Python or you're an experienced programmer working in the industry for years, we hope to have something for you there.

    Like last month, we're going to have three presentations with one of them being a 5-min lightning talk.
